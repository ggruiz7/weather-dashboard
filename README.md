# Weather Dashboard

## Plan Ahead! Check the Weather!

Use the search feature to search for any city in the world and see the current and future weather in that city.

### Features:

- Searching for a city presents you with current and future conditions for that city, and adds the city to the search history.
- Current weather conditions include the city name, an icon representing the conditions, the temperature, the humidity, wind speed, and UV index.
- Viewing future conditions presents you with a 5-day forecast that shows the dates, representations of conditions, temperature, wind speed, and humidity.
- Searched cities can be found in the search history.
